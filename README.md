# source_separation_ml_jeju
Source Separation Project For ML Jeju Camp 2017

## Overview

Two methods of separating monaural sources have been implemented during the month spent at ML Jeju Camp

## Projects

First project implemented Vector Product Neural Networks, referencing the paper 'Music Signal Processing Using Vector Product Neural Networks' by Fan et al. Find paper [here](http://mac.citi.sinica.edu.tw/~yang/pub/fan17dlm.pdf)

Files related to this model are model.py, run.py and config.py

Second project implemented Deep Clustering, referencing the paper 'Deep Clustering: Discriminiative embeddings for segmentation and separation' by Hershey et al. Find paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04306)

## Will be further updated
